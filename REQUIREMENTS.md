# Requirements outside of python

- Python >=2.7.3
- samtools ==0.1.19[commit 96b5f2294ac0054230e88913c4983d548069ea4e]

# Installation

  You may or may not be able to install these via your package manager(yum/apt)

  Typically you can download the tar.gz files for them and run the following commands
  
  ```
  tar xzf filename.tgz
  cd filename
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  ```

  More will follow but this will get us by for now
